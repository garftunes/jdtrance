They built a statue made of coal dust and shame
Carved from the mountains they won't say by name
Dressed it in denim, called it heritage proud
While the clinic shuts down and the factory's plowed
[Chorus]
Oh, they love their hillbilly effigy
Photo op in the heartland, wrapped in the flag so free
Praising bootstrap tales on the campaign trail
But the prescription's too high and the water's gone stale
Just a hillbilly effigy
Something to point at, nothing to see
[Verse 2]
They talk about values from their leather chairs
Quote the Good Book while cutting healthcare
Say those people should've worked a little more
From the penthouse suite on the forty-fourth floor
[Chorus]
Oh, they love their hillbilly effigy
Real America, they say, salt of the earth, you see
Waving at cameras in a factory town
Then the plant moves to Mexico, doors coming down
Just a hillbilly effigy
Something to use, then leave to bleed
[Bridge]
They need the story but not the people
Need the votes but not the sequel
When the cameras leave and the speech is done
The eviction notice has already come
[Verse 3]
So burn that effigy, let the ashes rise
We're not your story, not your alibis
Not your backdrop for your working-class drag
We're flesh and blood beneath this tattered flag
[Final Chorus]
No more hillbilly effigy
We're not your symbol, we're your economy
Built your railroads, mined your coal
Now we're asking for what you stole
No more effigy

JD Trance Productions Presents
Pre pre pre pre presents

[Verse 1] 
Down on 26th and Nicollet, the winter air is thin 'The New Sheriff' came to town to let the 'ideological war' begin 
You're sitting in the West Wing, JD, staring at a screen While the streets of Minneapolis look like a fever dream 

[Pre chorus]
Oh, JD, you're the ICE Queen, heart of frozen glass 
Watching basic human rights just wither in the grass 
You ignore the citizen, you hunt the immigrant down 
While blood is staining snowdrifts in a Midwestern town 
You're dreaming of a 'reset', a world of walls and wire 
But you're the one who's fueling the Minneapolis fire.

[Chorus] 
Oh, JD you're the ICE Queen, 
heart of a frozen tramp
Oh, JD you're the ICE Queen, 
by your Maker damned

[Verse 2] 
Alex was a nurse, JD, he knew how hearts would beat 
He wasn't looking for a fight when he stepped out on the street 
He saw a woman shoved aside, he went to help her rise 
Then the pepper spray and 'defensive shots' blinded all our eyes 

[Bridge - Tempo picks up, more aggressive] 
First it was Renee Good, now Pretti's in the ground 
Is this the 'common identity' that you say you've found? 
You say the courts are 'overturning the people's will'
But who gave you the permit for a license just to kill? 

[Verse 3] 
You talk about 'assimilation' like it's a holy rite 
But you're tearing up the fabric in the middle of the night 
Wake up from the trance, JD, look at what you've done 
You can't build a nation on the barrel of a gun.

[Pre chorus]
Oh, JD, you're the ICE Queen, heart of frozen glass 
Watching basic human rights just wither in the grass 
You ignore the citizen, you hunt the immigrant down 
While blood is staining snowdrifts in a Midwestern town 
You're dreaming of a 'reset', a world of walls and wire 
But you're the one who's fueling the Minneapolis fire.

There's a coin with his face minted yesterday
'Revolutionary,'' that's what the shills all say
Buy it at midnight, it crashes by dawn
But the wallet's in Dubai and the money's long gone

[Chorus]
It's the golden grift, the American way rebranded
Blockchain promises while the country's left stranded
Pay the toll, kiss the ring, get your access pass
To the Republic for Sale—everything's up for grabs
The golden grift keeps rolling on

[Verse 2]
Used to lobby through lawyers, now you just wire it straight
Million-dollar tokens buy a seat at the gate
'Draining the swamp' yeah, that's what they said
Now the swamp's got a penthouse and the books are all shredded

[Chorus]
It's the golden grift, democracy's fire sale
Regulations written by the highest detail
Cabinet seats going once, going twice
If you've got the crypto, we can name your price
The golden grift keeps rolling on

[Bridge]
They say it's 'innovation', call it 'financial freedom'
While grandma's pension's gone—she couldn't see 'em
Coming with their white papers and their blockchain dreams
Nothing's quite as promised, nothing's what it seems

[Verse 3]
There's a fundraiser gala at the Washington tower
Ten thousand a plate for an audience hour
'Support the vision', that's the email you'll get
But the vision's just a ledger of who owes what debt

[Verse 4]
They're pumping and dumping on the nation's dime
Insider trading used to be a crime
Now it's 'smart investment' when you know the play
When you write the rules for the regulatory agency

[Chorus]
It's the golden grift, and we're all getting played
Trading the Republic for a memecoin charade
They're cashing out while Rome burns bright
Blockchain libertarians with government oversight
The golden grift keeps rolling
The golden grift keeps going
The golden grift—we're all just holding their bags">

[Verse 1]
Come gather 'round voters, a story I'll spin
Of a man who wears virtue like a second-hand skin
I once called him 'Hitler', I once called him 'vile'
But I've traded my soul for a seat in the aisle
The hills of Ohio, they whisper my name
While I polish my suit and I enter the game.
[Chorus]
Oh, I'm dancing the waltz on a wire so thin
Changing my heart for the chance of a win
From the dirt of the hollow to the Washington hall
I'll stand for nothing to have it all.
[Verse 2]
I look at the ladies with cats on their knees
And I say they're a sickness, a social disease
'No stake in the future!'' I cry to the crowd
While the cheers of the angry grow frantic and loud
If you haven't a cradle, you shouldn't a-vote
That's the bitterest pill in my political note.
[Verse 3]
Then I speak to the women with bruises and tears
Who've lived in a shadow for far many years
I tell 'em 'Stay steady, don't seek a divorce'
(Though I've changed my own mind as a matter of course)
'Don't swap out a husband like socks on your feet'
For a stable home makes my victory sweet.
[Chorus]
Oh, I'm dancing the waltz on a wire so thin
Changing my heart for the chance of a win
From the dirt of the hollow to the Washington hall
I'll stand for nothing to have it all.
[Verse 4]
It's 'cultural heroin' clogging the street
And 'cultural genocide' makes us retreat
I'll talk of the borders and demographic gloom
To ensure that the seeds of resentment can bloom
And on the Great Silence—the right to decide—
I'll find a new platform on which I can ride.
[Bridge - Slow and somber, building to drop]
A federal ban? Well, it depends on the day
On the bend of the wind and the things that they say
I'm a man of the people, or a man of the elite
Depending on which one will give me a seat.
[Outro]
So play the harmonica, low and alone
For the man who has turned his own words into stone
I'm the Hillbilly Hero, the opportunist king
I'll play any song that you want me to sing.
Yes, I'll play any song... that you want me to sing.">

Truth Social strobe light, midnight post
Ghosting the truth like a holy ghost!
AI primates, the 44th’s face
Shifting the blame to a 'staffer's' space!
Vance in the corner, 'Lighten up, kid'
Counting the bodies the rhetoric hid!
Jeffries in a hat for a cheap-shot gag
While they’re burning the threads of the common flag!

[Chorus]
Eugenics on the radio, 'Bad genes' talk
Watch the way the old ghosts walk!
'Poisoning the blood', 'Island of trash'
Systemic rot for a campaign splash!

Springfield’s burning on a lie about a cat
Vance says 'Fabricate' and that is that!
Young Republicans praising the Reich
Leaked on a screen, ready to strike!
'Just kids being kids' with a Hitler salute?
The fruit is bitter when you poison the root!
Normalize the hate, hire the troll
DOGE man’s back to hollow the soul!

[Bridge]
Normalize Indian hate? NO!
Normalize eating pets? NO!
Shithole countries? NO!
Normalize the 'joke'? NEVER!

I found it! I finally found it! Let’s go!

[Verse 1]
I was living in a circuit, I was living in a shell
I was buying things I hated just to feel like I was well
I had a mountain made of silicon, I had a crown of wire
But I threw it in the dumpster and I set the heap on fire!
Now I’m running through the tall grass, feeling like a kid
I’m sorry for the weirdo things my ego ever did!

[Chorus]
I don’t want your property!
I don’t want prestige!
I don’t want your power!
I’m breaking out the siege!
I found a better purpose In the things that we can share
I’m lifting up my brother
‘Cause I finally fucking care!

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I’m serving up the dinner, yeah, I’m helping out the crew
I used to think about myself, now I’m thinking about you!
It’s a glitch in the system, it’s a bug in the code
To give away your heart while you’re walking down the road!
It’s not about the flex, it’s not about the clout
It’s about the way we scream when we’re helping others out!

[Bridge]
[Music stops. Just a tiny, bit-crushed voice]
Property... (Delete it!)
Prestige... (Forget it!)
Power... (I don't need it!)
ONE, TWO, THREE, GLITCH!

[Final Chorus]
I don’t want your property!
I don’t want prestige!
I don’t want your power!
I’m breaking out the siege!
I found a better purpose In the things that we can share
I’m lifting up my brother
‘Cause I finally fucking care!

Purpose! Purpose!
I’m serving everyone!
Purpose! Purpose!
We’ve only just begun!

[Verse 1] 
I just bought a jetpack with a credit card I found I’m screaming in the lobby, 
yeah, I love that crunchy sound Got 50,000 gigabytes of trash inside my head 
I’m eating copper wiring and I’m jumping on the bed! 
My skin is made of static and my teeth are made of gold 
I’m selling out the stadium before the tickets sold!

[Chorus] 
Pump it, dump it! Throw it in the trash! 
Pump it, dump it! I just want the cash! 
Pump it, dump it! Watch the screen go red! 
Pump it, dump it! Until I’m digital and dead! 
Pump it, dump it! Pump it, dump it! 
[Deep, distorted voice] GO!

[Verse 2] 
I’m a monster, I’m a lizard, I’m a motherboard on fire 
I’m climbing up the signal on the telephone wire 
I just Shorted out the market, now I’m living in a bin 
I’ve got a thousand shiny stickers underneath my skin! 
You’re talking like a person, but you’re sounding like a bot 
I’ll take everything you’ve given and I’ll give you what I got! 

[Bridge]
Everything is shiny... 
Everything is fake... 
I’m gonna eat the planet... 
Like a birthday cake...
